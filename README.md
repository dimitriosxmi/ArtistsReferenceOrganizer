ARO is an approach to prototype a tool that artists have yearned for forever but never got. I present to you the organizer for the reference images any artist needs to store in a clean manner when working on their projects. The days of scrolling through thousands of screenshots is over.

_**Warning**: This WebApp was styled for mobile first so it will look as its supposed to in a phone format. You can just use the developer tools of your browser to view it in phone dimensions._
